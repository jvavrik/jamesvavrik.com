My name is James Vavrik and I solve difficult problems for companies using technology. My bread and butter stack is .NET and Azure, but I don't shy away from the challenge of learning something new.

When I'm not building solutions, I'm either cooking, playing games with my son, or taking our [Golden/Shepherd mix pup Zelda](https://www.instagram.com/zeldavavrik/) on hike.

**Difficult Problems**

Difficult problems aren't just tricky algorithms, they're also about how to solve business problems through technology. It's about creating a solution that helps a business run more effeciently, economically, and agilely.
